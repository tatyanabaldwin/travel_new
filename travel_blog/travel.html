	  <h1>Welcome to My Dream Vacation: Japan</h1>
		<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/temple-pagoda-japanese-japan-1841296/ 
"><img src="travel_images/temple.jpg" width="200" height="136" alt=""/></a><span style="font-family: giddyup-std, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 30px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 500; color: #15A89E;">History!</span> Japan was settled about 35,000 years ago by the Paleolithic people who migrated there from the mainland. Later, after the ice age, a new culture developed called the Jomon. This was a group of people who lived their lives by hunting and gathering, living in homes may of wood, and creating vessels of clay. The Jomon lasted about 10,000 years until the start of the Yayoi period. This is when people introduced metalworking, rice cultivation, and weaving. Japan's unique culture started to develop during the Heian era.
		</p>
	  <p>During this period, there were major developments in art, literature, and architecture. The samurai warrior class developed around this time as well. In 1185, Samurai lords called shoguns controlled the government. The Kamakura shogunate ruled over much of Japan from 1185 to 1333. With the help of two miraculous typhoons, this shogunate was able to fend off the attacks by Mongol armadas. Later, it would be regional lords called "daimyo" would increase in power. Later in 1886, a new constitutional monarchy was established. The Showa Emperor, Hirohito, oversaw Japan's expansion during World War II, its surrender, and its rebirth as a modern, industrialized nation.</p>

"><img src="travel_images/japanese_meal.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="154" class="floatLeft"/></a><span style="font-family: giddyup-std, 'sans-serif;'; font-weight: 500; font-size: 30px; color: #29AAA3;">Food!</span> If I went to Japan, I want to try a lot of the food. Ramen is an example of a popular Japanese dish; it consists of flavored broth, noddles, and usually egg, sliced pork, vegetables, etc. to top it off. Sukiyaki is another dish I would want to try. This a hotpot dish with beef, noddles, and vegetables; it is usually cooked at the table in a shallow iron pot. Another dish would be Onigiri; this is a rice ball shaped into a triangular shape that is usually filled and wrapped in nori. </p>
		<p>Food is my favorite part of traveling anywhere so I would want to go to popular restaurants and try to go out more and see what its like. I usually tend to stay indoors but that would defeat the propose of traveling. I would also want to go by a convenience store and try more snack foods like an egg sandwich or candy. I have quite the sweet tooth and I think that trying different kinds of candy would be exciting. </p>

"><img src="travel_images/anime.png" width="200" height="141" alt=""/></a><span style="font-family: giddyup-std, 'sans-serif;'; font-weight: 500; font-size: 30px; color: #38AFA9;">Pop Culture! </span>I am so really into anime so this would be on my list of things to do. Of course I don’t need to go to Japan to watch anime. I would be able to see it sooner though so I wouldn’t have to wait as long. There are a lot of people here who don’t really get anime so I would want to see the difference in how people view it. Some of my favorites include: Parayste, A Silent Voice, Weathering with you, and I want to eat your pancreas.  </p>
		<p>Yes, I listed shows that have ended for a reason (no spoilers please). By watching anime I have also become interested in Japanese music as well. Hikaru Nara is one of my favorite songs that I have heard through watching anime. I first heard it one Your Lie in April(which I forgot to include in my favs). I can only sing along to certain parts but I want to learn to whole song. Racing Into The Night is another one I have heard and it is a really good song.</p>
